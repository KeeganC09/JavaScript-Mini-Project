## CoviSafe - Website to keep track of student’s Covid status!
### Description
<p>For the past one and a half year the global pandemic has disrupted every sector of society bringing barriers in its flow of operations. This has had a severe toll on society as a whole, but we the students have suffered the most due to long drawn out online classes. Since the number of cases are declining and restrictions being eased, colleges have planned to reopen. Our website will help the colleges to keep track of student’s covid related data which in turn will help colleges enforce necessary guidelines and SOPs for its smooth functioning post second wave.</p>
### Methodology
<p>Student data will be acquired with the help of a form. The students will have to furnish relevant details such as name, register number, year, department,  section, vaccination status, history of infection(if previously affected or not) and home state. If the student is fully or partially vaccinated he/she will be required to upload the vaccination certificate. This data will then be stored in a database which will be available to the college authorities for further reference.</p>
